                    <h4>Analysis of an Electrocardiogram</h4>
                        <p>I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Neuroergonomics Laboratory at Texas A&M. There were many research projects that <br>
                            were going on. I was on the research project that tried to quantify trust in a multi-human robot team in a first responder situation. <br>
                            There were experiments that were conducted and there was a lot of data that was analyzed. I was on the team that was analyzing an <br>
                            electrocardiogram of two people to find cardiac synchrony between them. It was a team project and the programming languages that<br>
                            were used was Python and R. A lesser known Python library that was used is the Neurokit Library. We also used RHRV and CRQA libraries <br>
                            to extract features that helped our analysis. The scientific instrument we used for data collection is Actiheart. The method of analysis <br>
                            that was used was Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis.

                    <h4>Black Jack</h4>
                        <p>This project is still in progress. <br>
                            It is coded in Python and I have been working Tkinter currently. <br>
                            Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. <br>
                            The game is relatively simple to learn but involves strategic decision-making. <br>
                            The primary objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as <br>
                            close to 21 as possible without exceeding it or "busting." Alternatively, you win if <br>
                            the dealer busts while you do not.<br>
