The system featured distinct views catering <br>to Customers, Managers, and Cashiers, providing a seamless  and <br>tailored user experience. The foundation of our project was built <br>on a robust backend developed in <b>Django</b>, complemented by an <br>interactive frontend designed using <b>React.js</b>. <br><br>The system incorporated fundamental functionalities such as a <br>secure login system, allowing users to access their designated <br>roles with ease. The integration of a <b>PostgreSQL</b> database ensured <br>efficient and reliable data storage, facilitating seamless interactions<br> and order management. One notable enhancement to our POS system<br> was the implementation of a user-friendly chatbot. This innovative<br> feature significantly improved the customer experience by assisting<br> users in navigating the interface effortlessly. The chatbot served as a <br>helpful guide, providing support and answering queries, thereby <br>contributing to a more streamlined and enjoyable customer interaction. <br>There was also Google OAuth that was linked with the login system, a <br>Weather API, Google Translate and certain accessibility features such<br> as text to speech and increasing font size of the overall POS system. <br><br>Concepts that were used: SQL, Django, React.js</p>')">POS System</button>
